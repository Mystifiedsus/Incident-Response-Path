### General Preparation

The purpose of creating a procedure is to find a guideline on how to manage threats/incidents to the existing organization or business partners in case they turn into a crisis. It is important to understand that there is no fixed definition of a cyber crisis. Each organization will define what a crisis is considering the impact on its production and the level of the organization’s capability of functioning. There are several standards related to crisis and security incident management:

  
  

- NIST SP 800-34: the beginning of the crisis

- ISO 27035: ensuring the security

- ISO 22301: continuity management system

  
  

A cyber crisis will not only impact IT staff and is not necessarily a purely technical issue. Here are some things you should know for such situations:

When it comes to ransomware in your team, the crisis won't be resolved in a few hours. You will need certain information to review and it will take a long time to acquire. In some cases, deadlines are incompressible. If you have to manually intervene on a server in a remote data center, the travel time is incompressible.

One of the first things to do is to properly prepare for a cyber crisis ahead of time. Therefore, we will present you with a flow of various stages.

  

### Inventory of your resources

It is important to have a list of your available resources in the event of a crisis, both technical equipment and personnel. While preparing this list, you need to make sure that it includes the answers to the following questions:

Do you have dedicated technical personnel for incident response?  
Do you have trained staff?  
Do the personnel who will be called upon have any requirements?

  
  

### Communication channels

If your organization is compromised, it is necessary to provide a secure communication channel apart from your infrastructure.

  

### Insurance

One of the crucial points often referred to at the end of remediation is insurance. When making the insurance, be sure to pay attention to the following headings.

  

### Are You Protected?

The first thing to know is if you are covered for crises of cyber origins. We need to make sure what our coverage is.

  

### Maximum Support?

As we mentioned above, the most important point to validate with your insurance is to define what is covered. For example, will the insurance pay a ransom for your ransomware-infected systems? The insurance companies usually cover the costs for a return to normal only and they do not pay the costs of improvements, special charges (staff overtime, purchase of equipment), etc.

  

### Partners

Finally, it is important to know if the insurance company will assign you a dedicated agent dedicated to responde to cyber crises’’.. This is a crucial point, as you will need special attention in such cases and therefore, we should make sure if our insurance company is providing such close attention.

### Tools

In order to respond effectively, it is necessary to have the tools available (USB key, on a dedicated workstation outside the network). Here is a list of tools that would help to respond during the investigation of a crisis.

Note: We have listed the free tools below. You can customize your own list for your organization’s needs.

  

### CAINE Linux

Italian live Linux distribution managed by Giovanni “Nanni” Bassetti. The project started in 2008 as an environment supporting digital forensics and incident response, with several related tools pre-installed.

  

### TSURUGI Linux

Tsurugi Linux is a DFIR open source project that is and will be totally free, independent, without involving any commercial brand. They state that their main goal is to share knowledge and “give back to the community”.

### Preparing the Response Units

As announced at the beginning, a response to a cyber crisis is not only related to the IT teams and should not exclusively mobilize IT teams. There should be at least two units in charge; the management unit, and the operational unit.

  

![](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/crisis-management/units.png)

  
  

### 1. Management Unit

  

#### 1.1 Role

This unit will decide on the strategic priorities for the response. It will be the one who will tell the Operational unit what must be remediated and restored first, as well as decide on the internal and external communications. It will also be responsible for responding to the concerns of the various departments and managing the impacts of the crisis.

  
  

#### Examples:

  

The production line is at a stoppage point, it is the Management Unit’s responsibility to decide

How the employees will get paid during this time

Who will ensure the payment of overtime for the teams

How to conduct internal communication as well as communication with customers, and the press

How to organize personnel scheduling and rotation

  

#### 1.2 Members

If there is a management committee, it will be the best practice to create a management unit amongst the management committee to speed up the decision-making process as they work together and know each other

  

#### 1.3 End of Crisis

It is this unit that will decide to end the organization’s crisis based on feedback from the Operational team. This decision may not mean that everything is resolved but that the company resumes "normal" operations.

Indeed, it is not possible to operate in a “crisis” over an extended period, both for the staff (who are under great pressure) and for the assets of the company (the costs may increase quickly when managing a crisis).

  

### 2. Operational unit

  

#### 2.1 Role

This unit will have to manage two main tasks. The reconstruction of a new internal infrastructure for an incident response as well as the restarting of infrastructure for business recovery, decided by the management unit.

  

#### 2.2 Members

This unit will be made up of expert and technical personnel. The experts may be responsible for investigating the workstations to find the origin of the attack or even trace the new infrastructure, while the technical personnel may be required to prepare workstations for members of other units.

  

### Expectations from the Operational unit

  

#### Identify the source of compromise

The Operational unit will have the task of finding the entry point of the attacker. It is not a question here of finding whether it is the “user a” from the accounting department or the “user b” from the communication department, but of knowing how the attacker entered the network in order to remediate this vulnerability to prevent the compromise of the new infrastructure from being subject to the same vulnerability.

  

#### Date of initial compromise

Now that we know how the attacker operates within the infrastructure, we potentially have a date when the threat appeared. It is important to determine the date of compromise as it will make it possible to determine which backups are compromised and which are still intact and reliable. Also, knowing when the attacker first got into our network and how long he/she accessed our network is crucial as it will help ease the whole investigation process.

  

#### Indicators of Compromise (IOC)

Knowing the attack vector along with the date of initial compromise will make it possible to generate indicators of compromise (IOC) in order to verify whether the restored backups are healthy. You can also scan backups using the IOCs you have. For example, if you have acquired a malicious file with the MD5 hash "ac596d282e2f9b1501d66fce5a451f00", you can check whether there is an infection by searching this hash in the backup systems.

  

#### Rebuild the new infrastructure

In parallel with the investigation, it is crucial to rebuilding infrastructure in isolation for the members of the various services.

  

#### Hardening

%100 security is almost impossible with the emerging technologies and the attacks and compromises we face are signs for us that shows our hardening was insufficient and our operational team will have to review and implement more strict hardening.

### Backups

Back-ups allow for a potentially quicker return to normal. back-up management is not a protection measure, on the other hand, a faulty back-up policy may lead to the end of the business.

Whether you’re backing everything up internally, to external hard drives, or to the cloud, etc. it is crucial that each back-up be encrypted and the keys available via a means external to your company’s IT systems.

  

### Rule of 3-2-1

The basic rule and the minimum expected for infrastructure, the 3-2-1 rule stipulates that you must:

Have at least three copies of your data

Store your back-ups on two different supports

Including an outsourced off-site back-up

  

![](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/crisis-management/3-2-11.gif)

  
  

### Three Copies

The principle is to have your data on the server and two back-ups. This is to prevent a failure from rendering your back-ups inoperative.

  

### Two Supports

Two supports mean having the back-up of our original data on two different and unrelated points. So it is possible to have two copies of the back-up on hard disks if both are not stored in the same data center, not linked via the same software RAID, etc.

  

### Offsite back-up

The idea behind this requirement is to have a back-up stored outside of your building that contains the main data in order to protect against risks such as fires.

  

### Rule of 3-2-1-1-0

This rule is to be applied at least to your company’s critical resources. Identical to the 3-2-1 rule, it adds two more requirements:

1 offline copy

0 error while restoring

  

### One Offline Copy

This is about having a back-up that is not tied to your network and any IT infrastructure. The goal is to avoid that if an attacker has compromised your network, he can intervene on this back-up.

  

### 0 Error While Restoring

This may seem a logical requirement, but it will be a good practice to test the back-ups regularly and to verify that they are restorable without error. It will be damaging if, once restored, it is discovered that a file on the database server is in fact damaged.

### Alerts and End of Crisis

### Alert the Authorities

Do you know who should be alerted, what is the maximum duration to alert them, and who is responsible for doing so? The answers to these questions vary from organization to organization, the standards that the organization must meet, and its location.

  

### Alert Your Partners

Keep in mind that you are not alone. If your information system is compromised, you can become a threat to your partners interconnected with your network. Similarly, perhaps the attacker has come from one of your partner’s networks and you, being more prepared, has detected it while your partner failed.

In any case, communicating with your partners is a good practice.

  

### End of Crisis

  

#### Destruction or Preservation of Traces

When the crisis is over, we should run the clean desk policy and any helpful notes on the post-its, A4 papers, notebooks, on the computer, etc. about the incident, must be destroyed.

In the case of ransomware, it may be interesting to keep encrypted files on offline storage in case the encryption keys may be accessed in the future.

  

#### Oversight

At the end of the crisis, the personnel tend to relax after having been under great pressure. It is therefore essential to supervise both your new infrastructure and the staff.

  

#### Service Providers

The service providers who have accompanied you will surely offer you to stay in contact, to sell you the “loaned” solutions for the resolution of the crisis, etc. Take the time to reflect.
