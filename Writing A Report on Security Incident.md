### Introduction to Technical Writing

One of the most important skills a SOC analyst must possess is the ability to write technical documents. Let's say you have analyzed an important ransomware case, you did everything as it should be, you identified the root cause of the incident, and took the necessary actions. If you cannot convey this situation to your teammates and management correctly, the process will not be considered complete. Because the rest of the team members could not master the details of the incident due to insufficient communication.

Everyone knows how important communication is in teamwork, so we won't emphasize it again and again. The subject of this training is to develop your skills in written communication. Some important issues to consider when writing a technical article/documentation/report:

- Audience

- Flow

- Intelligibility

  

#### Audience

Knowing who will read the content we will prepare is important to determine the details of the content. For example, let's say we are preparing an incident report that the CEO wants to read, your CEO's cybersecurity technical level may not be as deep as yours. Some details that are important to you (MITRE techniques, IOC, etc.) may be meaningless to the target audience. For this reason, it is necessary to create a report that appeals to people.

  

#### Flow

Regardless of who will read your report, your report should have a flow. It would not be appropriate to give some information about the end of the Incident and then explain the beginning and create confusion. For this reason, it is necessary to prepare a sequential report with a certain flow. Thus, the reader can create the timeline in his head.

  

#### Intelligibility

The sentences we use should be understandable to the reader. We should not complicate the understanding of the report by using complex, inverted sentences.

If we pay attention to these issues in general, we can say that a successful report will emerge.

  

### Why Do We Write Reports?

There is no single reason to create a report. Sometimes due to legal obligations, sometimes due to the request of the administrator, a report can be created. Even if there are no situations that require us as analysts to write a report, we should write a report of the events we examine.

Think of an incident you analyzed two months ago. How much detail can you remember about that situation? Assuming you review dozens of alerts every day, you can't remember much. When a new situation arises about the incident you examined two months ago, you will probably be the person your manager will want to get details from. However, if you do not have a written report or note, it will not be easy for you to respond.

Or imagine making a job change. You have all the information about the analysis you have done, the team has no idea about these situations. Such situations affect the transfer of information within the team in a negative way.

In short, writing a good report is important and must be written for the well-being of both the individual and the team. Although it is often seen as a waste of time and neglected, it provides the solution to many problems that may be seen in the future.

### Reporting Standards

The reports we will prepare must have a certain standard. Thus, the reader can guess whether the information they want is in the report or not, without reading the report, and can quickly reach the result if they are looking for just one piece of information. For example, an administrator who is curious about the root cause of the incident can quickly open and read the relevant section of the report. Otherwise, the entire report should have been read in detail. In this section, we will explain which topics we should pay attention to and touch on in general and technical (cyber security) in order to create a standard while writing a report.

  

### Intelligibility

As we mentioned in the Introduction section, content should be prepared according to the readership of the report. In a report to be sent to the CEO of the company, it will not be necessary to mention technical issues such as MITRE techniques and hacking tools used by the APT group. Therefore, you can create an "Executive Summary" section in the report and write a summary of the incident without mentioning the cyber security techniques.

  

### Timeline

Our report should proceed according to a certain timeline. It should be stated step by step what the attackers and the SOC team did on what date. The reader should feel himself in a short film. Thus, such questions are avoided: What did our team do while the attackers were doing activity X? When did you block the X.X.X.X IP address? etc.

  

### Repeatability

The technical details in the report should be written in a way that can be repeated. Let's say you find malware hidden on the server and add that file to the report that it exists. If you do not specify the methods and techniques you used to find this hidden file, the person(s) reading the report cannot perform these activities again. If the same incident happens again on a different date, the analyst reading the report will be wasting time because he or she will not be able to apply the same steps again.

  

### Focus on a single subject

The subject of your content should be fixed. If you are preparing an incident report, you should not mention matters unrelated to the incident. Thus, the subject's integrity is ensured and a more easily understandable report emerges.

---

### Reporting Style

### Past Tense Patterns

While preparing the report, you should prepare your sentences using past tense patterns. The main reason for this is that the event happened in the past.

  

### Short and Concise Sentences

Your sentences should be clear, short, and concise. As a result, you are preparing a report, not a novel, and you need to convey the information to the reader as soon as possible.

For example, instead of saying "Mysterious and frightening hacker group, whose identity is unknown, made SQL injection attempts on the team's favorite server, and failed against the security of our server", you can say "The attacker(s) of unknown origin attempted SQL injection on the web server and failed". A short and clear sentence can be formed.

  

### Share Important Details

Do not hesitate to share data that may be necessary when making a statement about a topic. “We have detected various malware on our servers.” sentence will not be enough for the SOC team. It is not clear what type of malware was detected on which server. “Mimikatz.exe malicious software that is used to capture user passwords has been detected on our web servers with IP addresses 192.168.10.15 and 192.168.10.16.” When you read this sentence, you can understand exactly what kind of threat is on which server.

  

### Focus on What You Do

In the report, you should mention the events that took place. For example, if you did not perform a memory analysis in the system, there is no need to specify that there is no memory analysis unless there is a very special situation. If giving this detail is important for the content of the report, information should be given about why the transaction could not be performed.

“The data in memory was lost because the operating system was restarted by the attacker, so memory analysis could not be performed.” A sentence created in this way is meaningful because it depends on the cause and effect relationship and can be found in the report.

  

### Be Careful When Using Abbreviations

Too many abbreviations are used in the cybersecurity world. Some of them are IOC, IDS, IPS, AV, EDR, etc. While these abbreviations may sound familiar to you, they may be meaningless to others, so you should specify the explanation when using them for the first time. For example, if you are using IOC for the first time in the report, you should write it as IOC (Indicator of Compromise). This way, the reader will better understand what you mean.

  

### Show Consistency in Using Words

For example, when describing a device at the beginning of the report, when using the word "host", instead of using different words such as "endpoint", "system", or "node" in a different part, it is necessary to use "host" continuously.

### Report Formatting

When creating a professional report content, it is necessary to set standards on issues such as date, font, text color, tables, and references.

  

### Date and Time

The same format should always be used when writing date information. For example, after specifying a date with "June 16, 2022", a format like "16/06/2022" should not be used. Standards should be maintained, using the same format over and over.

In terms of time, timezone information should be shared and the same timezone value should be used. A timezone value other than GMT+2 should not be used in the continuation of a report that starts with 06:12 GMT+2. Confusion may occur when used, and various calculations have to be made to better understand the report.

  

### Font

It is important to choose a font that is readable and formal. Font selections such as “Comic Sans” should be avoided even though they are pleasant but not official. Multiple font selection should not be an issue as long as consistency is maintained. For example, all the paragraphs of the report can be written in “Arial” font, while the headings can be written in “Verdana”.

  

### Table and Visual Usage

Appropriate use of tables are very important for the reader. If you want to list more than one content with more than one feature, the tables will help you. For example, you can show the list of hosts captured by the attacker with a table. You can also share the hostname and IP information of the host. Sample:

  

![](https://letsdefend.io/images/training/reporting/table.png)

  
  

### Data Details

If detailed information about the data is to be shared, the same details should be added for all data. For example, if the SHA256 hash of the “mimikatz.exe” file used by the attacker, file name, creation date, and path information is added to the report, the same data should be shared for other files used by the attacker.

  

### Lists

You can use bullet or numbered lists for long lists that you do not want to write in paragraphs. For example:

1. mimikatz.exe

2. nc.exe

  

- SusieHost

- GitServer

- Web-Server

### Report Templates

In order to prepare consistent reports, reports should follow an ordered template. This section will talk about the points you need to pay attention to when preparing an incident report template.

  

### Table of Contents

This is the section that specifies the content of the report. The titles and page numbers of the pages are specified. If there is a part that the reader wants to reach directly, he can use this part.

  

### Incident Background

This is the section that explains how an Incident is detected, what is detected first, and what actions are taken. Time information should also be shared while describing events. It doesn't need to be too long, a few paragraphs of explanation will suffice.

  

### Findings

This is the section where the findings we detected during the investigation will be explained.

  

### Recommendations

This is the section where long and short-term recommendations will be shared regarding the incident. For example, for a system affected by the MS17-010 vulnerability, a quick update may be a short-term recommendation, while investing in EDR solutions may be a long-term recommendation. It is a very important section for teams/persons who are not experts in the subject and will take action against this situation.

  

### Timeline

This is the section in which the event is sorted by time. There is no need to share all the details of the event, just focus on the important parts. The aim is to quickly convey how and at what time the event occurred in general.

The time formats given in this section should be fixed. While giving a time in UTC format in the first stage, using a format like GMT+3 afterward will cause confusion.

  

### Appendices

It is often used for long listings. If the list that needs to be shared is more than one page and affects readability, it can be shared in the appendix. For example, the IP list the attacker is port scanning.

In general, we talked about which sub-headings/sections should be in a report and their details. Now you have important ideas about what parts you should focus on when preparing a report.
