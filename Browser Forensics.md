### Introduction to Browser Forensics

Browser forensics is a type of digital forensics analysis that involves examining web browsers and their associated artifacts in order to extract evidence that can be used in a legal proceeding. This type of analysis can be useful for investigating threats such as insider threats, a cause of compromise, data exfiltration.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/1-+Intro+to+browser+forensics/1.png)

  
  

The process of browser forensics typically involves the extraction and examination of web browser history, cache, and cookies.  
  
**"Web browser history"** is a record of the websites that a user has visited and can provide important information about the user's online activities.  
  
**"Cache"** is a temporary storage area for web content, such as images and text, that is used to speed up the loading of websites.  
  
**"Cookies"** are small pieces of data that are stored on a user's computer and can be used to track the user's online activities.

In addition to analyzing these artifacts, forensics analysts should also examine web browser extensions, which are small programs that can be added to a web browser to add new features or functionality. Extensions can be used for a variety of purposes, including improving the user experience, enhancing security, or tracking online activities. We will discuss these and some more artifacts in detail in the coming lessons.

  
  

## Scope and Objectives

The goal of browser forensics is to provide investigators with a clear picture of the events that occurred on a computer or device and to help establish a timeline of those events. This can be particularly helpful in case of an incident where analysts can analyze a user's browser activity to determine root cause of an incident like a malicious website visited or a phishing link clicked. By carefully examining the artifacts left behind by web browsers, forensics analysts can gain valuable insights into a user's online activities and can provide important evidence in a legal proceeding.

Browser forensics can also be valuable for investigators looking to understand the details of an attack on a computer or a device. By examining the artifacts left behind by the web browsers, forensics analysts can gain insights into how an attack was conducted and can help identify the source of malware, adware, spyware, malicious emails, and phishing websites.  
  
There are many different web browsers available, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Opera, and the specific browser being used can impact the forensics analysis, however we will be conducting this exercise with Chrome browser.

In addition to its role in the criminal investigations, browser forensics can also be used in civil cases and in other legal proceedings where the examination of web browser artifacts may be relevant. For example, browser forensics can be used to investigate potential instances of workplace harassment or to uncover evidence of intellectual property theft. Overall, the role of browser forensics is to provide investigators with a thorough understanding of a user's online activities and to help uncover evidence that can be used in legal proceedings.

  
  

## A Typical Scenario

A company has reported that sensitive customer information has been leaked to a competitor. The company's IT department has conducted an initial investigation and identified a potential suspect who is a current employee of the company. The IT department has asked a forensics analyst to examine the employee's computer to determine if there is any evidence of the employee leaking the sensitive information.

The forensics analyst started a forensics image of the employee's computer. He first extracted the web browser history, cache, and cookies from the user’s computer by using forensics acquisition tools like FTK imager, Encase, Autopsy, etc. The analyst also examines the user's web browser extensions to determine if any of them could be leveraged for the stealing of sensitive information.

The analyst found that the employee had visited the competitor's website multiple times and had also been using a web browser extension that allows users to easily share files. Based on this information, the forensics analyst is able to establish that the employee had been using the company's computer to leak sensitive customer information to the competitor. The analyst provides this information to the company's IT department, which will support the company’s legal proceeding’s as an evidence related to the employee's actions.

At the end of the course, you will be given 2 different cases related to browser forensics to test your skills learned in the course.

### Acquisition

Forensic acquisition is the process of making a forensic copy of data from a computer's hard drive or other storage media. This process is typically performed as part of a forensic investigation, in which the copy of the data is used to extract and analyze evidence.

Forensic acquisition involves using specialized software and hardware to create a forensic copy of the data on the storage media. The forensic copy is an exact duplicate of the original data, and it preserves the integrity of the data, including any deleted or hidden files. The forensic copy is then used to perform forensic analysis and extract the relevant evidence. Forensic acquisition is an important step in a forensic investigation, as it allows investigators to preserve and analyze the evidence without altering or damaging the original data. This helps to ensure that the evidence is admissible in court and can be used to support legal proceedings.

  
  

In a typical scenario, we would acquire a whole disk image of a compromised or suspect endpoint to perform full disk analysis, not just browser analysis. Tools like FTK imager, Autopsy, Axiom can help us take full copies of our disk, bit by bit . We can then carve out the browser artifacts from the browser storage locations from the disk image. It's not recommended to perform forensic analysis on live image as data can be corrupted or tampered unintentionally. We will not be discussing acquiring disk images in this course as its out of scope, but we wanted to discuss it here because it's the industry standard for forensics investigations.

Browsers store user information like history, URLs visited, cache, cookies, and etc. in sqlite databases and json format. We can parse these to view the data relevant to us. 

For example below is the location where all the Firefox data like cache, cookies, bookmarks etc. are stored.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/2-+Acquisition/1.png)

  
  

Similarly Google Chrome has its own location where the user data is stored.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/2-+Acquisition/2.png)

  
  

Here are storage paths for some other common web browsers:

  

**Firefox:** “%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\”

**Edge:** “%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\”

**Opera:** “%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable”

  
  

We will discuss important artifacts found under Chrome storage location (majority of our artifacts will be under the default folder under the defined path), as to what they do, how they benefit us in our forensic investigations, how to track user(s) activities in different browsers using BrowsingHistoryView, how to manually analyze them using database sqlite reader and how to do with automated tools like Hindsight.

  
  

**Note:** We will only investigate Google Chrome browser artifacts in this course as it is the browser used the most, but the techniques are applicable to any of the browser.

### Browser Artifacts

Forensic artifacts are evidence or data that can be found on a computer or other digital device. These artifacts can be used to help identify who used the device, when it was used, and what it was used for. Examples of forensic artifacts include temporary files, log files, and deleted files, which can all contain important information that can be used in a forensic investigation. In this lesson we will discuss browser artifacts which helps investigating browser related activities and in next lessons we will analyze these manually and use automated tools.

  
  

Some common browser artifacts are:

- Search history

- Visited Websites

- Downloads

- Cookies

- Cache

- Bookmarks

- Favicons

- Sessions

- Form history

- Thumbnails

- Extensions

  
  

## Search History

Search history refers to information of any search terms used. This information is important because it can uncover users' intentions on by showing the exact URLs that the user typed in the search bar. The search history is saved in the SQLite database named “History” and is under the “keyword_search_term” table.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/3-+Browser+Artifacts/1.png)

  
  

“Search History” Artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\History**” on Chrome

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\places.sqlite**” on Firefox

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\History**” on Edge

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\History**” on Opera

  

**Note:** It is worth mentioning that Microsoft Edge and Opera have the same path and database names as Chrome. This is because these browsers are all Chromium based meaning they have same backend engine.

  
  

## Visited Websites

This artifact refers to a person's browsing history, including the URLs of websites visited, the dates and times of the sites visited. This information is a must for the browser investigations because we can find users' online activity, only through this information which can pinpoint the root cause of a compromise issue and speed up the investigation. This data is also stored in the “History” SQLite database and is under the “visits” table .

  
  

“Visited Websites” artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\History**” on Chrome

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\places.sqlite**” on Firefox

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\History**” on Edge

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\History**” on Opera

  
  

## Downloads

This artifact stores the downloaded files, their names and the URLs from where the resource was fetched. This is an excellent artifact as we can find out and investigate the file types that are downloaded which can help identify any malicious executables. This data is also saved in SQLite database named “History”, under the “downloads_url_chains” and “downloads” table.

  
  

“Downloads” artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\History**” on Chrome,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\places.sqlite**” on Firefox,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\History**” on Edge,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\History**” on Opera.

  
  

## Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on a users’ browsers by the websites they visit. Cookies help analyzing the websites that set the cookies, the data stored in the cookies, and the expiration dates of the cookies. These gives us information about the past web sessions, domain names, and etc. This data is stored in SQLite database “Cookies” (in network folder) and is under the “cookies” table.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/3-+Browser+Artifacts/2.png)

  
  

Cookies artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network\Cookies**” on Chrome,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\cookies.sqlite**” on Firefox,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Network\Cookies**” on Edge,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Network\Cookies**” on Opera.

  
  

## Cache

Web cache is a temporary storage location where the web-based data, such as HTML pages and images, are stored. The goal of cache analysis is to identify, preserve, and analyze this data in order to reconstruct the user's web browsing history and potentially uncover evidence. We can uncover frequently visited websites visited by users. This data is stored in many data block files which are indexed using a separate index file.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/3-+Browser+Artifacts/3.png)

  
  

Cache artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache\Cache_Data**” on Chrome,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\webappsstore.sqlite**” on Firefox,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Cache\Cache_Data**” on Edge,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Cache\Cache_Data**” on Opera.

  
  

**Note:** Only Opera cache is saved under “\Appdata\Local\*”, the rest of Opera data is stored under “\Appdata\Roaming\”

  
  

## Bookmarks 

Bookmarks are common artifacts in browser forensics, as they are a record of the web pages that users may have saved for later access. In most web browsers, bookmarks are stored in a dedicated folder or list, and they can typically be accessed by clicking on a "bookmarks" or "favorites" button. In browser forensics, bookmarks can be an important source of evidence, as they can provide information about the web pages that a user visits on a regular basis and the topics they are interested in. Reviewing bookmarks help reconstruct users’ web browsing history and identify patterns of behavior. Bookmarks are stored in a JSON file named “Bookmarks” under default directory.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/3-+Browser+Artifacts/4.png)

  
  

Bookmarks artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Bookmarks**” on Chrome,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\places.sqlite**” on Firefox,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Bookmarks**”  on Edge,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Bookmarks**”  on Opera.

  
  

## Favicons 

Favicons, also known as favorite icons, are small graphical images that are associated with a particular web page or website. These images typically appear in the address bar of a web browser, next to the web page's title or URL, and they are also often used as icons for bookmarking a page. In browser forensics, favicons can be an important source of evidence, as they can provide information about the web pages that users visit on a regular basis and as sell as the websites they are interested in. Important thing about this artifact is that the domain name of the website is recorded from where the favicon icon was loaded at the time of the request. So if the history file is removed from storage location, the websites names are still saved in favicon database. It is worth noting that not every website may have a favicon and especially the malicious ones. Also this artifact is a bit inconsistent in newer versions of browsers so we cannot fully rely on it. This is stored in a sqlite database named “Favicons” under default directory.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/3-+Browser+Artifacts/5.png)

  
  

Favicon artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Favicons**” on Chrome,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\favicons.sqlite**” on Firefox,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Favicons**” on Edge,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Favicons**” on Opera.

  
  

## Session file 

Session files are artifacts that can provide information about users’ web browsing activities even though its deleted history file is removed from the disk. This file contains information about the web pages that were open in the browser at a specific point in time during the last session. This information can include the URLs of the web pages, the titles of the pages, and any text that was entered into web forms. In some cases, these files can also contain information about the users’ browsing history and any cookies that were stored by the browser. Reviewing session and tab files can help reconstruct users’ web browsing history and identify patterns of behavior. In order to be useful, if the user deletes history and closes the browser, the session file will give valuable data as discussed. But if the user opens the browser for a new session, the previous session file will exist but its contents will be nullified and will be useless. This artifact can be useful for a scenario when analyzing a terminated employee's data, his/her last activities will be present in the sessions file. This is stored in a SQLite database named “Sessions” under default directory.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/3-+Browser+Artifacts/6.png)

  
  

Sessions artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Sessions\***” on Chrome,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\sessionstore.jsonlz4**” on Firefox (1)

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\sessionstore-backups\***” on Firefox (2)

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Sessions\***” on Edge

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Sessions\***” on Opera

  
  

## Form History 

Form history is an artifact that can provide information about the text that a user has entered into web forms. Most web browsers have a feature that saves users form data, such as the text they have entered into search boxes or online forms, in order to make it easier for the user to fill out similar forms in the future. In some cases, form history can provide valuable information about a users web browsing habits and interests, as well as any sensitive information that may have been entered into online forms. We can discover passwords, credit card information and etc. through the “Form History”. This is stored in SQLite database named “Web Data”.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/3-+Browser+Artifacts/7.png)

  
  

This artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Web Data**” on Chrome,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\formhistory.sqlite**” on Firefox,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Web Data**” on Edge,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Web Data**” on Opera.

  
  

## Thumbnails 

Thumbnails are small, reduced-size version of a full-sized images or videos that are typically generated by a web browsers. These thumbnails are often used to help organize and navigate through large collections of media files, and are commonly found in the cache or temporary files of a web browser. They can provide valuable clues for forensic investigators, as they can help identify the types of media that a user has accessed or downloaded, and can also provide information about the website or online service where the media is originated .

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/3-+Browser+Artifacts/8.png)

  
  

Thumbnails artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Top Sites**”on Chrome,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Top Sites**” on Edge,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Top Sites**” on Opera.

  
  

## Extensions 

Browser extensions , also sometimes referred as "Addons" is a small piece of software that can be installed into a web browser to add additional functionality or features. Extensions are typically used to enhance the user experience, such as by providing tools for organizing tabs, blocking ads, or saving passwords. Extensions can be malicious either from a shady third party vendor , or it can be a case of supply chain attack where legit extensions are hijacked and are made to do malicious actions. This can be a good source of evidence in case malicious extensions cause an incident. If you want to learn more about malicious extensions you can [try to solve this](https://app.letsdefend.io/challenge/suspicious-browser-extension/) challenge on LetsDefend.io. Extensions metadata is stored under Extensions folder, and randomized named folders.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/3-+Browser+Artifacts/9.png)

  
  

Extensions artifact is located at;  
  
“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\{randomfoldername}\***”on Chrome,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[randomfoldername]\extensions\***” on Firefox,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Extensions\{randomfoldername}\***” on Edge,

“**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Extensions\{randomfoldername}\***” on Opera.

  
  

In next lessons we will explore these artifacts to gain invaluable experience vital for our investigations.

### Tool: BrowsingHistoryView

In this lesson, we will be review a tool called “BrowsingHistoryView” by Nirsoft. BrowsingHistoryView is a utility that reads the history data of different Web browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Opera) and displays the browsing history of all these Web browsers in one table. The browsing history table includes the following information: Visited URL, Title, Visit Time, Visit Count, Web browser and User Profile. BrowsingHistoryView allows users to watch the browsing history of all user profiles in a running system, as well as to get the browsing history from external hard drive. You can also export the browsing history into csv/tab-delimited/html/xml file from the user interface, or from command-line, without displaying any user interface. BrowsingHistoryView tool is really helpful when it comes to displaying information in a very friendly GUI view. It can parse information from a live system or from disk image which is very convenient for forensics investigations and it supports multiple browsers. You can [download this tool](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/browsing_history_view.html) at the following link for free.

We will be using the GUI version of this tool, but it is worth noting that there's a CLI version as well.

When we install and open the tool we see an advanced options menu where we can apply filters according to our needs, select browsers we want to target etc.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/1.png)

  
  

We can filter the web history by its age; by the date and time that the URL visited exactly. You can see that we are setting the filter to display data since the last 10 hours in the below example.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/2.png)

  
  

We can also specify the time range and the data to be displayed during the specified timeline. This feature is particularly useful as a Forensic Analyst or Incident Responder because if we know the time frame of when an incident occurs, we can apply date filters around those time frames to pinpoint the user activities before or after the incident. This can help us find the cause of incident or objectives of the attacker (in case of insider threats).

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/3.png)

  
  

Next, we have 2 types of string based filters:

  
  

## 1- Matching strings:

Matching Strings filter allows us to specify known strings which we want to know if they exist in browser history or not. This can be useful if we have some known IOCs or domain names (Threat actor using multiple randomized subdomains) or we want to know if the user searched for anything specific or not. We can specify multiple strings separated by a comma “,”.

Below example will display the URLs which have “letsdef” and “facebo” in the URL address. As you might have guessed, the below filter will display all URLs which belong to letsdefend and/or facebook or have these specified strings in URL (which is not likely).

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/4.png)

  
  
  
  

## 2- Non-Matching Strings

Non-Matching Strings filter allows us to specify known strings which we don't want to be displayed. This can be useful if we want to cut down the noise and filter out known good URLs (Maybe common in organizations like company web portals etc.). We can specify multiple strings separated by a comma “,”.

Below example will not display URLs which have “goog” and "githu" string in URL address. We can guess that this filter will not display any google or github domains.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/5.png)

  
  

We can use both these match/non-match filters concurrently which will make our analysis easier if we have large amount of data.

Next, we can select browsers from which to collect data;

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/6.png)

  
  

We can also select the user/profile to be analyzed on the system. This can be very helpful in Active Directory environments or where multiple users are sharing a workstation.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/7.png)

  
  

Now, lets explore this tool:

We selected everything default along with the Chrome browser only.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/8.png)

  
  

The tool displays the URL, the title of that page, the total number of the connection to the site, the site where the traffic is redirected from, as well as the total time that was spent on the URL.

Now let's apply a filter to display the URL related to letsdefend and cyberjunnkie sites.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/9.png)

  
  
  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/4-+BrowsingHistoryView/10.png)

  
  

In this lesson, we explored “BrowsingHistoryView” a very handy tool to search through browser history with patterns of our preference. This tool is mostly handy for Live machine analysis when the computer is used by more than one user like a shared workstation. 

In the next lesson we will cover the browser databases which we discussed in the artifacts lesson and see what kind of data we can find.

### Manual Browser Analysis

In this lesson, we will manually analyze some of the artifacts we previously discussed. We will use the "DB Browser for SQLite" tool to read databases we discussed earlier. We will also use the strings tool to read contents of session files which helps us recover online activities even if history was deleted.

  
  

## DB Browser SQLite

DB Browser SQLite is a tool that helps viewing, editing and deleting columns, tables, rows, etc. in a database structure. It’s official descriptions says:

“DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.”

DB4S is for users and developers who want to create, search, and edit databases. DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned.

You can download the tool at the [following link for free.](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)

Once we install and run the tool, we first navigate to the folder where most of our artifacts are stored: “%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default”

**Note:** %USERPROFILE% is the user’s root location like “C:\Users\cyberjunkie\”

  
  

## Web History 

We will first analyze the “History” database and discuss what contents we can find.

Right click on the “History” file and select “Open with”.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/1.png)

  
  

and then select “DB Browser for SQLite”.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/2.png)

  
  

**Note:** If you can’t find “DB Browser for SQLite” here then you can click on “More Apps” option and select the tool manually. Default path of installation is “**C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite\DB Browser for SQLite.exe**''

  

Now the file is open inside the tool.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/3.png)

  
  

“Database Structure” is the first tab that displays the name if the tables and some more database metadata. Table names are useful for our analysis because the name tells us what data is stored under the table. Like in the above example the URLs table will have the URLs that the users visited.

The data will be viewed in “Browse Data'' tab. Here we can view the columns and rows of each table.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/4.png)

  
  

In the Table dropdown menu, we can select the table which we want to analyze.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/5.png)

  
  

Let’s select the URL table and view the data.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/6.png)

  
  

We can see the visited URLs. Now let’s download a file using Chrome browser and then view the downloads table of the history database.

**Note:** Remember that the database file should not be open while the browser is open as it can corrupt the database.

  

We downloaded an image to show you this artifact.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/7.png)

  
  
  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/8.png)

  
  

We can see the file location, and the URL where the file was downloaded from in the referrer tab. This information can be useful in determining malicious websites and downloads.

  
  

## Favicon 

Next, we will explore the “Favicon” database which gives us the visited websites information. This artifact can be useful because if the history file is deleted, we can find visited URLs here. It is important to note that this table only displays websites which have favicons, those without favicons will not be stored here. We need to select the “favicon” table to be able to see the data stored here.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/9.png)

  
  

Some websites don't store their assets like favicons in their main domain. They use subdomains or cloud storage. We can still have an idea on what domain it belongs to by looking at the URL. For example the 4th favicon URL“paypalobjects.com” indicates that the user visited PayPal website. This way we can track what type of websites were visited by the user.

  
  

## Top Sites 

Another good source of gathering user online activity is the “Top Sites” database. This also gives us information on the websites that the user visits if the history file is deleted.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/10.png)

  
  
  
  

## Web data 

This artifact can prove to be a goldmine for a forensics analyst. Whenever a user fills login information, credit card information, addresses or any other type of data that the browser can save the browser asks us whether we want to save the information and when next time we visit the same website, that data gets auto filled and user does not need to fill out the required information if we save them.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/11.png)

  
  

All this data gets saved in "web data" database. We can also retrieve the URL history, typed keywords in front this valuable artifact. Now let's open this database and see:

We can get valuable information regarding websites visited, the favicon information etc. from the “keywords” table.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/12.png)

  
  

We can find emails, usernames etc. from the "autofill" table.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/13.png)

  
  

We can recover some of the credit card information like the card number, and the expiration date and such. Credit card numbers are mostly encrypted depending on the payment gateway. If we are lucky we can get our hands on the credit card numbers, CVV code, card expiration date. Credit card forms do not store credit card numbers and CVV normally due to the nature of the data, while the expiration date is stored since it's not as sensitive in nature. However, it still depends on the developer of the credit card payment gateway, the payment API being used etc. This also allows us to track the user's online transactions and the type of the goods and services that the user has purchased.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/14.png)

  
  

We can find information like the address, and the phone numbers, etc. if the user saves these data on the browser. In the below image, we input address in a form as "Letsdefend” and we can see that in table “autofill_profile_addresses”.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/15.png)

  
  

We can find more personal data depending on how the users’ usage habits of the browser. The “web data” database is a very valuable artifact as it can provide us vast amount of personal information about the individual’s user habits.

  
  

## Extensions 

We have discussed extensions and how they hold the forensic value. Now we will find information about extensions installed on our browser.

Go to the path “**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\**”

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/16.png)

  
  

You will see randomized folders in this location. Each folder belongs to an extension/add-on installed on the browser. We will need to go inside the folders and find the name of extensions by reading metadata files or viewing the icon images etc. We can do this automatically using tools like Hindsight which we will discuss in the next lesson.

Let’s go to the first folder and take a look at the files to find information about the extension.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/17.png)

  
  

We can also determine the extension by the images.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/18.png)

  
  

Extension analysis and version information would really help us if especially the system was compromised via a malicious extension. We can perform the analysis for that extension and setup measures like blocking that extension etc.

As we can see, this FoxyProxy extension which is a handy proxy directly from the browser.

  
  

## Session file 

We will analyze the session files now. As previously mentioned, the session file will provide us a good value only if the user deletes the history and closes the browser. But if the user opens the browser as a new session, the previous session file will still exist but its contents will be nullified and will be useless. We will delete the history of the user session then close the browser, then analyze the latest session file (as there will be multiples of them). We will open this file with the ‘strings’ tool from sysinternal to be able to read it as contents of the session file are not in a user friendly format to read. You can download this tool from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/strings).

Path for the session files is “**C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Sessions**”

We will use strings via cmd on this file.

**Note:** Remember to add the file path in quotes. The a (-a) switch stands for ASCII only.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/19.png)

  
  

For better visibility redirect the output to a file.

Full command will be:  
  
**Command:** "strings64.exe -a "C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Sessions\Session_Filename" > filename.txt“

We get some information about the user activity even though the history was deleted.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/5-+Manual+Analysis/20.png)

  
  

In this lesson we explored how to navigate and utilize different type of browser data stored in SQLite databases using a simple database viewer tool. This approach can help us dig deeper and find more information that the automated tools may miss out due to the nature of the data and the tool. Something that an automated tool won’t define as important enough may be a deal breaker to help solve the case. The more the data, the more context and evidence we have. But this doesn't mean you shouldn't use automated tools as there's a very limited triage time during incident investigations so automated tools are great for quick analysis. Manual approach is suitable for forensics analysis where we try to investigate deeply on how the incident occurred. 

  
  

**Note:** Please do not open Chrome browser in the lab as it can modify the data related to questions. Use the Microsoft Edge browser if you need to.

### Hindsight Framework

This tool is of great assistance to speed up the browser forensics process. It automatically parses and displays valuable browser information which we would typically do by browsing databases as discussed in the previous lesson. Official description for Hindsight is as follows:

Hindsight is a free tool for analyzing web artifacts. It started with the browsing history of the Google Chrome web browser and has expanded to support other Chromium-based applications - with more to come! Hindsight can parse a number of different types of web artifacts, including URLs, download history, cache records, bookmarks, autofill records, saved passwords, preferences, browser extensions, HTTP cookies, and Local Storage records.

You can get this tool [from here](https://github.com/obsidianforensics/hindsight/releases/tag/v2021.12).

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/1.png)

  
  

We will use the GUI version which will let us interact with the tool on the local port.

When you run the binary, Windows smartscreen will prevent execution but run it anyway.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/2.png)

  
  
  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/3.png)

  
  

Now, access the tool in your browser through “[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)” address. If you are analyzing Chrome present on your live system, we suggest to run this tool on another browser like Microsoft Edge, or Firefox. This is recommended so we don't tamper with potential artifacts and evidence by using the same browser on which analysis is to be performed.

This is how the main interface looks like.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/4.png)

  
  

First, we select the the browser we want to analyze in the input type. This tool is still new in the wild and is actively developed so for now it only supports Chrome and Brave browsers.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/5.png)

  
  

Then, we need to input the storage location where the browser data is saved in “Profile Path” Input. This can be the default location which we have been referring to since the beginning of this course or it can be a custom path which can be used if you have imported disk image or artifacts files from other computer under investigation.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/6.png)

  
  

The plugin selector allows us to select plugins we want to use. For most of the cases, all are recommended to be selected since we want as much information as possible. If however you have some use case where you only want to review some specific extensions you can only select the relevant plugin. We will use all plugins in this example.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/7.png)

  
  

It also shows us the default Chrome data location for different operating systems which is convenient.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/8.png)

  
  

Now we will just click “Run” on the lower right corner. We will be redirected to a results page shortly where we will be given an overview of type of artifacts that were found and parsed, and the plugins produced valuable data.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/9.png)

  
  

We can view the data as an Excel sheet, JSON or SQLite database and analyze them just like we did in the previous lesson but in this case we will have correlated artifacts results under the same database saving us a lot of time. It also has a convenient SQLite engine built in which allows us to navigate the database right from the browser and also execute SQL queries to get desired results in no time.

We can select the available tables to analyze the data.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/10.png)

  
  

Here, we have “installed_extensions” table selected and it displays the information about the plugins. We explored this same type of data in manual analysis but this time the tool has done it automatically.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/11.png)

  
  

Next up, we have a “storage” table selected which displays information parsed from cookies, cache, and "Web data'' database which stores auto fills, and form history information.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/12.png)

  
  
  
  

## Recovering Deleted Information

Another great feature of Hindsight is that it is capable of analyzing the “Site Characteristics”  database. It is a feature of Chrome that tracks different behaviors on websites, such as if the site changes the title, favicons etc. It works by holding a key/value pair where the key is MD5 hash of origin, website and value is a protobuf value. Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data. It was developed by Google to be mainly used in Google products. We won't go in detail about what this value is but we rather go over how this proves it is effective forensically. Hindsight calculates MD5 sum of every origin URL it finds from any of the artifacts and compares it with the key in the “Site Characteristics Database”. If any match exists then that key in site characteristics is replaced with the origin URL. For no matches the key value remains as MD5 hash. We can prove that a user visited a particular website using this technique when history is deleted. This artifact can help us find origin of the URLs that have no trace in other artifacts. If we want to find traces of specific websites we visit, then we can calculate md5 sums of the URLs we want to find and compare them with the key MD5 values.

Let’s see this in action. Our third table was a timeline which displays data in chronological order. Here we can see the data from “History” database, "Top Sites" database, “Bookmarks” database, and etc. which shows us the URL information. The first row shows the above procedure we discussed in action. We visited letsdefend website from the browser and deleted the history. But we can still find the evidence of the domain.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/13.png)

  
  

We can also use the “SQL queries” to see the type of column we want to see. For example, if we only want to see the URLs in timeline table, then we should enter this query: SELECT URL FROM 'timeline' LIMIT 0,30” which basically means to display the URL column from a table named ‘timeline’ and Limit the display to 30 rows on each page.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Browser-Forensics/6-+Hindsight/14.png)

  
  

We can also display multiple columns or data from different tables according to our needs.

  
  

In this lesson, we have discussed how quick and valuable using Hindsight in browser artifacts investigations.
